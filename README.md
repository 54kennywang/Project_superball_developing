# superball-need-improvement-
My closest experience about designing game player to choose the smartest move possible (like AI chess player). Main challenge is rate the board after potential move (before each move, try all the possile moves to see which after-board gets the higest points based on my rating system).

8*10 board starts with 5 pieces of random color. Two types of moves below. Different colors worth different points, try to score points as many as possible. Game over when board is full.

1. swap: swap any two pieces. After each swap, another 5 random pieces will be added (random positions on board and random color)

2. score: if more than or equal to 5 pieces of same color are connected by edges, can score.

see command_use.txt for compliation;

see where_to_improve.txt for how to improve;

see CS302 -- Lab 5 -- Superball!.pdf for specific instructions;

written shellscript (run_multiple.sh) is to score my program;

Superball.jar is the game exectuable;

best on record is 31,814.13 on average 100 runs.
